# Hand Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow & OpenCV

Gesture recognition is an active research field in Human-Computer Interaction technology. It has many applications in virtual environment control and sign language translation, robot control, or music creation. In this machine learning project on Hand Gesture Recognition, we are going to make a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python.

Prerequisites for this project:
1. Python – 3.x 
2. OpenCV – 4.5
Run “pip install opencv-python” to install OpenCV.

3. MediaPipe 
Run “pip install mediapipe” to install MediaPipe.

4. Tensorflow 
Run “pip install tensorflow” to install the tensorflow module.

5. Numpy 
Run “pip install numpy” to install Numpy.

# Steps to solve the project:

1. Import necessary packages.
2. Initialize models.
3. Read frames from a webcam.
4. Detect hand keypoints.
5. Recognize hand gestures.
